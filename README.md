Supermarket billing system is based on the concept to generate the bill reports and to add items and update their details. The whole concept is designed via c++ language.

This supermarket billing system is a simple console application built in C++ without the use of graphics. This project will help you understand basically two things â€“ use of stream class and file handling in c++ programming language.
